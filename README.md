# WebPPL
[WebPPL](http://webppl.org) is a Probabilistic Programming Language, built over JavaScript. This repository contains gists written in WebPPL that highlight WebPPL's inference capabilities.

## Bayesian Regression
Bayesian regression allows us to estimate parameters as well as the probability density over the parameter space, conditional on training data.
See [bayesian_regression.js](bayesian_regression.js) to see how to perform Bayesian linear regression in WebPPL.
